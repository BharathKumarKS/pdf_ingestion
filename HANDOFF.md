## Scope decision (settled)

**Single-user now.** The `tenant_id` plumbing exists but is **not enforced** — there is no auth,
and the UI takes the tenant from a text box. Deliberate deferral: **multi-tenancy is the final
stage, after metrics are solid.** Do not "fix" auth or tenant isolation while working on metrics,
and do not add new `tenant_id` defaults.

---

## Current focus — P0-9, the gold-set rebuild (Sessions 1–2 done; Session 3 next)

Gates all of P1. **Required-`N` is now measured** (Session 1, below). Two documents, both committed:

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.hermes/plans/2026-10-06_174001-p0-9-gold-dataset-v2.md` | Full plan: tasks 0–8, decisions D1–D10, power analysis. **Read only your task's section** — do not load all 1044 lines. |
| `.hermes/plans/p0-9-SESSIONS.md` | The session split: which tasks belong in which fresh session. |

### Session 2 delivered 2026-10-12 — the tools exist (no large LLM spend)

| Tool | What it does now |
|---|---|
| `scripts/generate_gold_dataset.py` | + `--multipage-count`: overview/multihop questions from distant page triples (`min_gap` 60). D10 applied — `max_tokens` 512→2048, and an empty generation batch retries, logs the raw response and **raises** instead of silently returning `[]`. |
| `scripts/validate_eval_calibration.py` | Parallelized (Task 4a): one open PDF + per-page image/text cache, disk verdict cache keyed by (query_id, page, model, prompt-hash), thread pool (`--workers`, default 8), one shared `httpx.Client`. D9 — each page judged from its rendered **image** plus full text, not `text[:800]`. New `--ramp-probe`. |
| `scripts/expand_gold_labels.py` | Widens `relevant_pages` to every page that answers the question, via the two-pass scan. `--dry-run` / `--limit N`. |
| `scripts/generate_negatives.py` | Three-tier negatives, accepted only if a full scan finds no YES page. `--dry-run` / `--n N`. |

Verified: each tool passes `--dry-run` and a stubbed `--limit`/`--n` probe; the hot pages are
judged once, not twice; a re-run makes zero judge calls. **D9 verified live** against the cluster
VLM (p254 → YES "½mv² is kinetic energy", p3 → NO copyright page, ~0.8 s/call). Suite at the
floor: **211 pass / 5 fail / 5 skip**.

### Session 3 delivered 2026-10-13 — the scan ran (all three steps, exit 0)

Judge `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` @ `http://10.0.10.70:8000`, `--workers 8` (ramp-probe knee:
4.21 calls/s, 0 errors; 16/32 collapse to ~1.2/s from queueing). Commits `1870dc9`, `8e81572`.

| Artifact | Content |
|---|---|
| `data/eval_queries_gold.json` | 103 questions — 55 factual / 8 overview / 40 multihop |
| `data/eval_queries_gold_expanded.json` | 66/103 queries widened to >1 page (max 134), scan-expanded |
| `data/eval_negatives.json` | 24 negatives, 8 per tier — **see caveat** |

**Four blockers had to be fixed first** (Session 2 only ran `--dry-run`/stubs, so they survived):
the run-order command omits `--judge-backend openai` (defaults to Anthropic → 401); `call_llm_raw`
posted to `{base}/chat/completions` (gateway serves only `/v1/...` → 404); 2048 `max_tokens` was
still too small for `gpt-oss-20b`'s reasoning trace (content came back null/truncated → raised to
8192); and the model's LaTeX (`\(m v\)`, `\frac`, `\theta`) is not valid JSON (`\f`,`\t`,`\n`,`\b`
even decode to control characters) → `_extract_questions` now escapes every backslash but `\"`/`\\`.

> ⚠️ **Negatives are NOT trustworthy — resolve before Session 4 uses them.** `generate_negatives`
> accepted **24/24, including 8/8 near_miss**, but the plan predicted near_miss would *mostly be
> rejected* (Vol 1 does discuss these topics). Acceptance rests on the coarse pass (stride 15 = 63
> of ~938 pages) plus a dense pass that only fires around a coarse hit; for 5 of 8 near_miss no
> coarse page was even PARTIAL, so only 63 pages were judged. Term-bearing content pages were never
> seen — p107 (radioactivity → the carbon-14 half-life question), p754 (tungsten), p103/562/763/898
> (laser) have **no cache entry at all**. "A full scan found no YES page" is not a full scan.
> **CONFIRMED 2026-10-13** by a targeted term-page re-scan (`logs/p0-9/verify_negatives.py`, same
> VLM): at least one negative is **definitively invalid** — `neg-nea-004` ("half-life of
> carbon-14") is answered by **p107**: *"Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5000 years."* `neg-in_-001`
> (Schrödinger/hydrogen) also returned YES, but on **p944 — the index** ("## Index -9"), i.e. a
> judge artifact. Several more show PARTIALs on real content (Fourier, superconductivity, general
> relativity, Jupiter). **Prune/reclassify before Session 4 uses this file.**
> **Fix before trusting:** re-verify negatives with a full/stride-1 scan (or dense passes around all
> term matches), or accept that this tier needs Session 5 human review.

### Next actions before Session 4 (ordered — do in a FRESH session)

1. **Prune + re-verify the negatives** (`data/eval_negatives.json`) — see the caveat above. Drop
   `neg-nea-004` (answerable on p107); decide `neg-in_-001` (index-page YES); re-verify the
   term-bearing survivors (full `--scan-stride 1`, or Session 5 human review). **Blocks Session 4**,
   because negatives are the only source of the abstention metric.
2. **Stop index/back-matter pages counting as hits.** The VLM returns YES on the book's index
   (p944 → YES for a Schrödinger question), and index pages are retrievable, so this inflates
   recall in the *real* eval too — not just the negatives. Fix **before** the Session 4 A/B series,
   or the reranker comparison is measured through it. See "Index-page false hits" below.

### Index-page false hits (why + where)

Retrieval excludes front matter but **not back matter**: `store.py` filters on
`min_content_page` as a **lower bound only** (`page_number >= min_content_page` — lines 193, 228),
so the index/bibliography at pages ~940–968 stays retrievable. A `_NON_CHAPTER` keyword list
already exists in `store.py` (`"## subject index"`, `"## index\n"`, `"bibliography"`, …) but is
wired **only** into the RAPTOR rebuild path, not retrieval or the scan. Layered fix, cheapest first:
(a) judge criterion — YES means "this page contains the answer", index/contents/cross-reference
pages are PARTIAL at most (fits D8's graded 0/1/2, so the strict YES-only primary is unaffected);
(b) deterministic backstop — detect index pages by structure and gate them, don't trust an 8B VLM
(it said NO on the index for one question and YES for another); (c) corpus hygiene — an upper bound
(`max_content_page`) or exclude non-chapter pages at ingest, which removes the false-hit surface for
the product too (needs a re-ingest — its own item, honour the `clean_stale_*` ordering); (d) make it
visible — an index-page probe in the test suite, and/or a "fraction of retrieved pages that are
back matter" metric.

### Decisions settled 2026-10-12 (do not re-litigate)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| **D1** | **Sequential design** — start at 40, extend in blocks of 30. **Recompute σ_d per comparison** (it differs: reranker 0.2315 vs merge 0.118). Do **not** stop naively at the first CI that excludes 0 — pre-register the stopping rule. |
| **D6** | **Fresh file** `data/eval_queries_v2.json`; **do not reuse v1's queries** — v1's provenance is mixed (early labels were retriever-derived → circular). Consequence: **all historical artifacts become non-comparable**; re-run the whole A/B series on v2. Do **not** carry v1's visual queries over — regenerate or calibrate them. |
| **D8** | **Graded 0/1/2** (NO/PARTIAL/YES). Report **Recall@k on YES-only as the strict primary**, graded nDCG as the secondary. D6 removes the v1-comparability constraint that forced a binary choice. |
| **D9** | **Scan the page as an IMAGE** (`Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` on the cluster) **plus full text** — not the current `text[:800]`. Prerequisite for Task 4. |
| **D10** | Raise `max_tokens` (512 → 2048); make an empty generation batch **loud and asserted**, not a silent `[]`; bounded retry; log the raw response on failure. |

Also settled (2026-10-06): **3-way RRF *with* the cross-encoder stays**; the reranker decision is
deferred to the powered test (F4b). The ColBERT `is_query` fix (`b4cb637`) is correct regardless
of its unresolvable effect, and **needs no re-ingest**.

### Why P0-9 blocks everything — five conclusions, all unresolvable at n=23

σ_d = 0.2315 (reranker comparison, **measured** — `IMPROVEMENTS.md` §F4b) → SE ≈ 0.05 at n=23.
Paired-power **`N = 0.4206/δ²`** for the reranker: **62** to detect the observed 0.083, **169** at
δ=0.05, 43 at δ=0.10. The merge comparison is quieter (σ_d = 0.1184 → 45 at δ=0.05). Recompute σ_d
per comparison — do not reuse one number across comparisons.

| # | question | measured | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | does the cross-encoder help? | 0.651 → 0.569 (**−0.082**) | blocked |
| 2 | ColBERT better as voter or judge? | 0.598 vs 0.651 | blocked |
| 3 | did the ColBERT `is_query` fix help? | −0.022 / −0.049 | blocked |
| 4 | abstention precision | **unmeasurable** — zero negatives | blocked |
| 5 | any per-query-type claim | ~5 queries/type | blocked |

**Do not run another A/B on the 23-query set.** More measurements there generate more
unresolvable numbers, not more knowledge.

## P0 status

| # | Item | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1–6 | baseline committed; silent fallbacks killed; sklearn pinned + classifier schema-checked; config-invariant tests; doc drift fixed; eval gate + CI | `6381f7b`, `c3a8727` |
| 7 | metric set fixed (`Precision@k` → `Recall@k` + `Hit@k`) | `1dad73f` |
| 8 | judge lane measured — **1040 judge calls, 0 failures** | `dce5efd`, `data/eval_results/p0-judge-canonical_2026-10-06_0010.md` |
| 9 | **gold-set rebuild** | Sessions 1–3 done — `ca3324e`, `52d2179` (measure) + `5cbf564`, `4f112b0`, `fffc3b3`, `c9d8d0c`, `668cd0f` (tools) + `1870dc9`, `8e81572` (scan) on `feat/p0-9-gold-dataset-v2`; **next: Session 4 — assemble & decide (negatives need re-verification first)** |

Test suite: **211 pass / 5 fail** (`uv run pytest tests/ -q -m "not slow"`). The 5 are
**pre-existing** — `tests/test_splade.py` (×2) hardcode a missing `tests/data/sample_physics.pdf`,
and 3 search tests return 0 results. **Not regressions; do not "fix" them here.**

---

## Session hygiene

Start each P0-9 stage in a **fresh** session (`/new`) and read only that stage's section of the
plan. The previous long session reached ~271k tokens/call with 2 lossy compactions behind it —
**do not continue P0-9 inside a compacted session.** See `p0-9-SESSIONS.md` for the split and the
handoff steps.

---

## Priority plan (agreed)

**P0 — make the numbers trustworthy.** 1–8 ✅ · **9 ⛔ gold set (active critical path)**

**P1 — then improve metrics** (all gated on P0-9)
10. Ranking — overview MRR 0.191 is the one genuinely bad number. Cheapest first: config
    (MMR λ / RRF) → the cross-encoder → hard-negative fine-tuning.
11. Calibrate the 7 `visual` queries (folds into P0-9).
12. Per-lane attribution in the eval report (which lane moves which query type).
13. Test the fallback chains — stub tests cannot reach them.
14. `render_math()` golden-file test — ends the LaTeX patch cycle (partly done).

**P2** abstention · guardrails · PPR · semantic caching · OKF cards

**P6 — kept, deferred to the very end:** NiceGUI migration. **Explicitly wanted — do not drop
it from the plan, and do not start it early.** Frontend stays Streamlit until then.

Full backlog, categorised by why each item is not done yet (queued / fix / deferred-by-decision /
gates), with cost classes and re-ingest ordering: [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](IMPROVEMENTS.md).

## Verified facts — trust these over any doc

| Thing | Truth |
|---|---|
| Feynman Vol 1 PDF | **968 pages** (report says 940, README says 990 — both wrong) |
| Cluster `knowledge_base` | 5,135 points (5,051 chunks + 84 RAPTOR nodes), doc `6d55c52b` |
| SQLite `chunks` | 5,048 — the 5,135−5,048 gap is **unexplained; re-measure, don't trust** |
| Dense embedder | **Nomic 768d + 64d MRL** (`embedding_model` in `config.py`) |
| Reranker | `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` |
| Chunker | `chonkie.SentenceChunker` (class named `SemanticChunker`) |
| Intent classifier | 768d `LogisticRegression`, pinned `scikit-learn~=1.9`, schema-checked at load |
| Card types | **8** in `CardType` (single source for `DA_CARD_TYPES`) |
| Eval queries | 30 = 23 calibrated non-visual + 7 uncalibrated `visual` |
| Baseline (v1, 23 q) | Recall@20 **0.636** · MRR 0.365 · NDCG@6 0.377 |
| Judge lane (v1, 23 q) | Faithfulness **0.701 (a floor)** · Ans.Relevance 0.927 · Citation 1.000 |
| Judge gateway | **`http://10.0.10.70:8000`** — serves `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` (the D9 VLM) among 6 models; ~0.8 s per page judgment at concurrency 1. The P0-9 plan's `10.0.10.51:8000` is **dead**. |

---

## Traps

**→ `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 (invariants and traps) and §11 (environment notes).** Read §8 before
your first change. The three that matter most for P0-9:

- **ColPali MaxSim is not 0-1** — scores run to ~1031; the configured threshold is 600.
- **Re-run `clean_stale_visual.py` after every Phase 3 re-ingest** (and `clean_stale_graph.py`
  after every re-ingest), or every page returns twice.
- **Retrieval is not bit-reproducible** (HyDE at temperature 0.3) — nothing below ~0.07 is
  measurable until HyDE is pinned. Pin it before any P0-9 A/B.
- **The judge must be a VLM, and `JUDGE_MODEL` is unset in `.env`.** The D9 scan sends the page
  **image**, so `--judge-from-env` alone judges with `openai/gpt-oss-20b` — text-only, it cannot
  see the page. Pass `--judge-model Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` (and `--judge-api-base
  http://10.0.10.70:8000`) explicitly for the Session 3 scan.

The `reliability-lab` plugin injects a "[Reliability lab — pipeline A]" banner into the user turn
when this profile is armed (`mode: "A"`). It is **profile-wide**, so it leaks into unrelated chats.
